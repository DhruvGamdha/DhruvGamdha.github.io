## Hi, I'm Dhruv Gamdha

I am a Ph.D. candidate and HPC software developer focused on GPU acceleration, PDE solvers, and large-scale simulations. I enjoy building high-performance algorithms to tackle complex geometry and physics problems.

- Specializing in CUDA, MPI, and FEM-based PDE solvers.
- Experience at NVIDIA, LBNL, and IIT Madras.
- Interested in HPC, Simulation, and Advanced Computational Engineering roles.
