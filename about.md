I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical & Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, focusing on High-Performance Computing (HPC) and advanced simulation techniques. My experience includes working at NVIDIA and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where I developed GPU-accelerated algorithms and scalable PDE solvers for complex geometries and large datasets.

**Core Interests:**

- **HPC & GPU Acceleration:** Expert in CUDA, MPI, and PETSc for distributed memory architectures.
- **Computational Geometry & FEM:** Skilled in finite element methods, NURBS-based geometry, and PDE-driven modeling.
- **Data-Driven Approaches:** Applied autoencoders, U-Nets, and graph algorithms to enhance image analysis and defect detection.

Beyond research, I enjoy collaborating across disciplines—bridging engineering, computer science, and applied math—to create efficient, reliable, and insightful computational solutions.
