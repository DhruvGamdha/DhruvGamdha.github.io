# About Me

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical & Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. My research and professional internships have centered on accelerating large-scale simulations using GPUs and distributed computing frameworks. I have experience with NURBS-based geometries, PDE solvers, finite element methods, and HPC tools like CUDA, MPI, and PETSc.

I thrive in interdisciplinary teams, bridging the gap between complex mathematical models and efficient code implementations.
